# API Reference

This section should contain the reference materials for the REST API of your offering. The name of each API element will be selectable from the left-hand navbar. Names of the elements of this REST API will appear as subheadings. In this template, the generic REST terms are given as subheadings, but you'd have something like **getAccount** or **editRules** as the actual subheading. If your offering has several components, each of them could have its own REST API. In that case, you'd use H2 and H3 as shown in the following example "skeleton," but of course you'd be using the actual names for each of the components and API interfaces.
