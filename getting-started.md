# Getting Started With Local Load Balancer

Effective June 01, 2019, IBM Cloud will no longer market or sell our Local Load Balancer service. As a customer, you can still receive support for this service until its End of Support date, which has yet to be announced. A 90-day EOS notification email will be sent at a later date. Customers are encouraged to upgrade to our latest full-featured load balancing offering: [IBM Cloud Load Balancer](/docs/infrastructure/loadbalancer-service?topic=loadbalancer-service-getting-started).

To get started with the IBMÂ© Local Load Balancer, you will first need to order it using the instructions here.
{: shortdesc}

To do so, navigate to the order page in the IBM Cloud catalog:

1. From your browser, open the [IBM Cloud catalog ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com){:new_window} and log into your account.
2. Select the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) from the top left, then click **Classic Infrastructure**.
3. From the left, select **Network > Load Balancing > Local**.
4. Select the Local **Load Balancer** tab, then click **Order Local Load Balancer**.
5. Choose **Location** from the dropdown menu where you would like the Local Load Balancer.
6. If you would like a shared Local Load Balancer, choose the number of connections desired and whether you want SSL offload or not from the **Select VIP** section.
7. If you would like a dedicated Local Load Balancer, choose the number of connections and whether High Availability is desired from the **Select Dedicated** section.
8. Click **Continue** to confirm the order.

Shared Load Balancers are provisioned immediately and can be seen within minutes of ordering.

Dedicated Load Balancers depend on hardware availability in the location requested. Once provisioned, the Load Balancer will show up on the Load Balancers list page and you can click on it to view the details. Additional VIPs can be ordered for Local Load Balancers by opening a Sales case.
