4. Click on the **Order Local Load Balancer** link on the top right hand side.
5. Choose **Location** from the dropdown menu where you would like the Local Load Balancer.
6. If you would like a shared Local Load Balancer, choose the number of connections desired and whether you want SSL offload or not from the **Select VIP** section.
7. If you would like a dedicated Local Load Balancer, choose the number of connections and whether High Availability is desired from the **Select Dedicated** section.
