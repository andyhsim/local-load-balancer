2. Select the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) from the top left, then click **Classic Infrastructure**.
3. From the left, select **Network > Load Balancing > Local**.
4. Select the Local **Load Balancer** tab, then click **Order Local Load Balancer**.
5. Choose **Location** from the dropdown menu where you would like the Local Load Balancer.
6. If you would like a shared Local Load Balancer, choose the number of connections desired and whether you want SSL offload or not from the **Select VIP** section.
7. If you would like a dedicated Local Load Balancer, choose the number of connections and whether High Availability is desired from the **Select Dedicated** section.
8. Click **Continue** to confirm the order.

Shared Load Balancers are provisioned immediately and can be seen within minutes of ordering.

Dedicated Load Balancers depend on hardware availability in the location requested. Once provisioned, the Load Balancer will show up on the Load Balancers list page and you can click on it to view the details. Additional VIPs can be ordered for Local Load Balancers by opening a Sales Ticket.
