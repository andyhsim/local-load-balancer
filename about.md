# About Load Balancing
{: #about-load-balancing}

Load Balancing is a way to distribute processing and communications evenly across multiple servers within a data center so that a single device does not carry an entire load. Load Balancing is essential in situations where it is difficult to predict the number of requests issued to a server, and can distribute requests that would have been made to a single server to ease the load and minimize latency and other issues.

IBMÂ© Local Load Balancing enables customers to employ a variety of balancing methods to distribute traffic, including persistent and non-persistent options, that can be changed, activated and deactivated at any time.
