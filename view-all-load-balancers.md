All interactions with an IBMÂ© Cloud Local Load Balancer take place from its Details page where you can manage Service Groups, view statistics and see the SSL Offload status.

To view the list of Local Load Balancers and access an individual Local Load Balancer's Details page, perform the following procedure:

1. From your browser, open the [IBM Cloud catalog ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com){:new_window} and log into your account.
2. Select the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) from the top left, then click **Classic Infrastructure**.
3. From the left, select **Network > Load Balancing > Local**.
4. From the **Load Balancers** list page, click on the **Local Load Balancer** tab to view the list of Local Load Balancers.
5. Click the **VIP Address** link to access the **Details** page. Alternatively, you can click on **Actions > View Details** in the dropdown menu on the row corresponding to the Local Load Balancer you would like to manage.

The **Local Load Balancer Details** screen defaults to the Service Groups tab, which allows users to add, delete or edit Service Groups, reset connections or add a service. Statistics may be viewed for each Service Group from the Statistics tab and the SSL Offload tab allows for [SSL Offloading configuration](/docs/local-load-balancer?topic=local-load-balancer-configuring-ssl-offloading-on-a-load-balancer).
