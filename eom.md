# Local Load Balancer End of Marketing Announcement
{: #alb-end-of-marketing-announcement}

Effective June 01, 2019, IBM Cloud will no longer market or sell our Local Load Balancer service. As a customer, you can still receive support for this service until its End of Support date, which has yet to be announced. A 90-day EOS notification email will be sent at a later date. Customers are encouraged to upgrade to our latest full-featured load balancing offering: [IBM Cloud Load Balancer](/docs/infrastructure/loadbalancer-service?topic=loadbalancer-service-getting-started-with-ibm-cloud-load-balancer).
