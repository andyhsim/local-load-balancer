# Upgrade Connections Limit

Local Load balancers can be upgraded at anytime in the increments of 250, 500, 1000, 2500, and 5000. All changes made will be in increments to the next level, but multiple upgrades can be made in sequence to jump multiple increments. 

To upgrade the connections limit, follow these instructions:

1. From the [Local Load Balancer Details](view-all-load-balancers.html) page, click **Actions > Upgrade Connections Limit** in the dropdown menu for the Load Balancer.
2. A confirmation dialog displays showing you the next increment available for your load balancer and the cost of the upgrade. Confirm the upgrade by clicking **Yes**. Click **No** to cancel the action.

The new connections limit goes into effect immediately.
